Intent is to perform an action. It is mostly used to start activity, send broadcast receiver, start services and send message between two activities. There are two intents available in android as Implicit Intents and Explicit Intents.

setData() is used to point to the location of a data object (like a file for example), while putExtra() adds simple data types (such as an SMS text string for example). setData() is used for the Android System to find an application component that matches the data attribute in implicit intent.

setType() lets you set the type of data that you are using to send in an intent.
